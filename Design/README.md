# Design
This repository contains both side projects and projects completed for the course:
 - IN2000 - Software Engineering with Project Work
 
Please access the files using the Figma application. In case this is not feasible, you may utilize the links provided beneath each project-heading.

## Bingers
I'm working on a side project in which I aim to create a website where users can have profiles displaying the movies and TV series they've watched and their respective ratings. Users will be able to follow each other and view their friends' viewing history and opinions on different films. Below, you can find a link to the first draft for the website design.

## Bastionen
This is an initial version of a website design for Lyn's support club, Bastionen.

## Prototype IN2000
Our team developed an app for tourism in Oslo, and this is the final version of the interactive prototype that I designed with my group members.

This Figma prototype is designed to showcase the interactive components of the user interface. To identify which elements are clickable, simply click anywhere on the screen (ideally in the center). The clickable components will be highlighted, allowing you to easily explore and interact with the prototype's functionality.
