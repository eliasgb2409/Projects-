<h1>IN3110 - assignment 2</h1>

This program allows you to create both 1d-arrays and 2-d arrays.
***

<h3>Usage</h3>

To create an array you have to use two parameters ```shape``` and ```value```. 
Shape defines the dimensions of the array and how many values an array should contain in that 
given dimension. Value defines the elements that the array will contain. 

When creating an array the class will check different edge cases to evaluate if you've
created the right array-type. 

With an array-object you can do the following operations:

- Element-wise add Array with another Array or number -
- Element-wise subtract Array with another Array or number -
- Element-wise multiplie Array with a number or array -
- Compare an Array with another Array -
- Compare an Array element-wise with another Array or number -
- Return the smallest value of the array -
- Return the mean value of an array -
- Flatten a N-dimensional array of values into a 1-dimensional array -

<h3>Unit tests</h3>

Run the file ```test_array.py``` to start the program. This file will carry out various tests of the
funcionality in the file ```array_class.py```.
